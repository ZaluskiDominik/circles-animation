<h1> Description </h1>
One of my first javascript projests written in order to practise creating animations.<br/>
Circles are floating within canvas, bouncing from its borders. When mouse cursor is placed near a circle it starts growing
to its maximal radius. When user clicks within canvas boundaries all circles starts moving to the point where the click occured.
<h1> Installation </h1>
